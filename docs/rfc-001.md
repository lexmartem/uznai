3. Create the initial database schema with Flyway migrations:
   - Users table
   - Roles table

   - Questions table
   - Answers table

### Frontend Setup
1. Initialize Next.js project with the required dependencies:
   - TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS
   - ESLint and Prettier
   - shadcn/ui component library
   - Axios for API requests
   - TanStack Query for data fetching

2. Configure core frontend infrastructure:
   - Tailwind CSS configuration
   - ESLint and Prettier setup
   - Base layout components
   - Type definitions
   - API client setup
   - Environment variable configuration

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration:
   - Lint code
   - Run tests
   - Build application
   - Deploy to development environment

## Implementation Progress

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- Setting up proper database migration strategies with Flyway
- Configuring security properly from the beginning to avoid refactoring later
- Establishing a scalable project structure that supports future RFCs
- Configuring cost-effective hosting while ensuring good performance
- Properly configuring virtual threads for optimal performance

### Performance Considerations
- Configure connection pooling appropriately for the database
- Set up proper caching headers for static assets
- Implement response compression
- Configure appropriate JVM settings for Spring Boot application
- Leverage Java 21 virtual threads for I/O operations
- Configure thread pools appropriately to take advantage of virtual threads

### Security Considerations
- Configure secure headers for the application
- Set up CORS policies
- Initialize security configurations (to be expanded in RFC-002)
- Ensure secure database credentials handling

### Java 21 Feature Usage
- Configure Spring Boot to use virtual threads for servlet processing
- Set up Executor service with virtual threads for background tasks
- Use appropriate configuration to leverage Java 21's improved performance
- Ensure hosting platforms support Java 21 runtime

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for repository interfaces
- Integration tests for database migrations
- Health check endpoint tests
- CI pipeline verification tests
- Virtual thread behavior tests for concurrent operations

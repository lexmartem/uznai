  theme: {
    screens: {
      'sm': '480px',   // Mobile (landscape)
      'md': '768px',   // Tablet
      'lg': '1024px',  // Desktop
      'xl': '1280px',  // Large Desktop
    },
  }
}
```

### Component Library Enhancements
1. Extend shadcn/ui components with:
   - Mobile-optimized variants
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Responsive adaptations
   - Improved loading states
   - Accessibility enhancements

2. Create new specialized components:
   - QuizCard (responsive quiz display)
   - QuestionNavigator (adaptive navigation)
   - ResultsChart (responsive visualization)
   - MobileMenu (optimized for touch)
   - ResponsiveForm (adapts to screen size)

### UI/UX Enhancements

#### Design Tokens
```javascript
// Design tokens for consistent UI
const colors = {
  primary: {
    50: '#f0f9ff',
    100: '#e0f2fe',
    // ... other shades
    600: '#0284c7', // Main primary color
    // ... other shades
  },
  secondary: {
    // Secondary color palette
  },
  // Other color definitions
};

const spacing = {
  xs: '0.25rem',
  sm: '0.5rem',
  md: '1rem',
  lg: '1.5rem',
  xl: '2rem',
  // Other spacing values
};

const typography = {
  // Typography scale
};
```

#### Animation Standards
```css
/* Base transitions */
.transition-standard {
  transition-property: all;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  transition-duration: 150ms;
}

/* Enter/leave animations */
.animate-fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 200ms ease-in-out;
}

/* Other animation definitions */
```

### Implementation Approach

1. Create a responsive foundation:
   - Implement responsive layout components
   - Create media query hooks for component-level responsiveness
   - Set up breakpoint-based styling with Tailwind

2. Update existing components:
   - Audit and update all existing screens for responsiveness
   - Enhance UI with loading states, animations, and feedback
   - Apply consistent design tokens and patterns

3. Create specialized responsive components:
   - Build components optimized for mobile usage
   - Create alternative views for different device sizes
   - Implement touch-specific interactions

4. Improve accessibility:
   - Audit and fix accessibility issues
   - Add ARIA attributes
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Test with screen readers

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- Ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers and devices
- Optimizing touch interactions without compromising desktop usability
- Handling complex forms on small screens
- Maintaining accessibility across responsive breakpoints
- Optimizing quiz-taking experience for mobile users

### Performance Considerations
- Minimizing layout shifts during responsive adjustments
- Reducing bundle size with optimized responsive images
- Implementing efficient lazy loading for different viewports
- Optimizing animations for low-powered devices
- Avoiding performance bottlenecks on mobile

### Accessibility Considerations
- Ensuring sufficient touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- Maintaining readable text sizes across devices
- Providing alternatives to hover interactions for touch devices
- Maintaining keyboard navigation for all screen sizes
- Ensuring screen reader compatibility for all responsive variants

### Edge Cases
- Extremely small mobile screens (e.g., old iPhones)
- Ultra-wide desktop monitors
- Devices with unusual aspect ratios
- Older browsers with limited CSS support
- High pixel density displays
- Touch-enabled desktop devices

### Testing Strategy
- Cross-browser testing on major browsers
- Device testing on actual mobile and tablet devices
- Responsive testing using browser dev tools
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard
- Performance testing on lower-end devices
- User testing for UX validation

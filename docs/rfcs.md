# Uznai Quiz Platform - Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the complete implementation roadmap for the Uznai quiz platform, organized into sequential RFCs (Request for Comments) that must be implemented in numerical order. Each RFC represents a cohesive unit of functionality that builds upon previously implemented RFCs.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into four phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Core infrastructure, authentication, and database setup
2. **Core Features Phase**: Basic quiz creation, quiz taking, and user profiles
3. **Advanced Features Phase**: Real-time features, quiz sharing, and discovery
4. **Premium Features Phase**: AI integration, PDF processing, and subscription model

## Dependency Graph

```
RFC-001 → RFC-002 → RFC-003 → RFC-004 → RFC-005 → RFC-006 → RFC-007 → RFC-008 → RFC-009 → RFC-010

```

## RFCs in Sequential Implementation Order

| RFC ID | Title | Phase | Complexity | Dependencies | Description |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| RFC-001 | Project Setup & Infrastructure | Foundation | Medium | None | Initial project setup, CI/CD pipeline, database configuration |
| RFC-002 | User Authentication & Profile | Foundation | Medium | RFC-001 | User registration, login, session management, and basic profile |
| RFC-003 | Quiz Creation & Management | Core | Medium | RFC-002 | Manual quiz creation, editing, and management features |
| RFC-004 | Quiz Taking & Results | Core | Medium | RFC-003 | Quiz access, completion, and results display |
| RFC-005 | Responsive Design & UI Enhancement | Core | Medium | RFC-004 | Cross-device compatibility and UI/UX improvements |
| RFC-006 | Quiz Sharing & Discovery | Advanced | Medium | RFC-005 | Quiz sharing links, public quiz discovery, and search |
| RFC-007 | Real-Time Quiz Sessions | Advanced | High | RFC-006 | WebSocket infrastructure, live sessions, and leaderboards |
| RFC-008 | Quiz Rating & Social Features | Advanced | Medium | RFC-007 | Rating system, feedback, and social interactions |
| RFC-009 | AI Quiz Generation | Premium | High | RFC-008 | OpenAI integration for quiz generation from text prompts |
| RFC-010 | PDF Processing & Subscription Model | Premium | High | RFC-009 | PDF text extraction for quiz generation and premium subscriptions |

## Implementation Sequence

Each RFC will be implemented one at a time in strict numerical order. No parallel implementation will occur - each RFC must be fully completed before the next one begins. This ensures a logical build sequence where each implementation builds upon the foundation established by previous RFCs.

### Dependencies Explained

1. **RFC-001**: No dependencies (starting point)
2. **RFC-002**: Depends on RFC-001 for infrastructure and database setup
3. **RFC-003**: Depends on RFC-002 for user authentication and profiles
4. **RFC-004**: Depends on RFC-003 for quiz creation and management
5. **RFC-005**: Depends on RFC-004 for quiz taking functionality
6. **RFC-006**: Depends on RFC-005 for complete core quiz features
7. **RFC-007**: Depends on RFC-006 for quiz sharing and fundamental features
8. **RFC-008**: Depends on RFC-007 for real-time infrastructure
9. **RFC-009**: Depends on RFC-008 for completed social features platform
10. **RFC-010**: Depends on RFC-009 for AI capabilities and completes the platform

This sequential implementation order ensures that each RFC builds upon a stable foundation, with increasing complexity and functionality as the project progresses.
